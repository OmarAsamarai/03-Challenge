## <li> According to the intructor, the obligation was to prepare a randomlly pasword generator.

## according to tht acceptance criteria I started with the propts to ask the person the assigned questions:
## <li> To choose numbe of characters of the password between 8 and 128.
## <li> To choose if they want numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
